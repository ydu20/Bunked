# Bunked Roommate Matching

This is a roommate matching application developed to funciton similarly to popular dating apps. This allows users to input their preferences about rooming (e.g. sleep time, messiness, etc.) and the app will generate suitable recommendations from it. Users will then be able to swipe through potential roommates and be able to have conversations with their 'matches'.
